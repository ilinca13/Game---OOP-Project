# WastelandRoots – Growing Life from Waste in a Post-Apocalyptic World 🪴💚🪏

## Description - Project Overview

In **WastelandRoots**, players cultivate plants in containers made from **recycled waste**. Each plant goes through unique **growth stages** and requires timely **watering**, as neglect can cause **sickness** or even **death**. ♻

Before planting, every **container type** must be thoroughly *cleaned* with the **appropriate substances** to remove harmful toxins. Plants can also be treated with special **healing potions** to recover from poisoning caused by toxic debris. 🚿🌱️

Each plant that reaches **maturity** *generates* an **item** for the player. The item can later be used to build a **base** or other structures inside the game (e.g., garden corners, greenhouses, storage). ⛺️🧰

The **ultimate goal** is to manage your plants carefully and keep them healthy, allowing them to reach **maturity** and become *harvestable*, ultimately creating *your own thriving and sustainable garden*. 🏡👩‍🌾
